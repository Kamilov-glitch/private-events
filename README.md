Project: Private Events

I'm gonna build a site similar to a private Eventbrite (not when it comes to looks, but more like when it comes to functionality) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which can be just stored as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

This project will require to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about foreign keys and class names.
